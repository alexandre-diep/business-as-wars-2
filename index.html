	<p>“War is a trial of moral and physical forces by means of the latter... In the last analysis it is at moral, not physical strength that all military action is directed... Moral factors, then, are the ultimate determinants in war.”</p><p>
Clausewitz emphasizes the definitive importance of  “moral factors” . He makes the claim that once you have destroyed your enemy’s spirit ,  you have won the war.
The leader of a company needs to rally employees and gain their trust. They should be clear about the company's business objectives to help motivate employees. In this way they can achieve overall organizational success.

<p>Moral factors in strategy of McDonald’s: McDonalds make possible the replace of value by matching the money paid by customers with quality and diversity of products and services. McDonald objective the customer happiness by food preparation the penchant to formulate the customers feels satisfied about the cost exchange. The mission of McDonald’s is to be the world’s best quick service restaurant experience. Being the best means providing outstanding quality, service, value, and cleanliness so that we make every customer in every restaurant smile”.

	<p>“We need a philosophy of strategy that contains the seeds of its constant rejuvenation — a way to chart strategy in an unstable environment.”</p><p>
In fast-changing conditions, static methods don’t work. An organization’s survival depends on the mastery of a dynamic process for generating ongoing renewal. Companies need to develop dynamic business strategies to cope with competition.
Adaptation strategy of McDonald’s: McDonald’s has implemented menu customization for various countries of operations that has actually complicated the menu items.


</p>	
<p>Dynamic business strategies - Breakfast Menu Items:  McDonald’s has recently launched new additions in its menu items and offers an expanded breakfast menu. The strategy is quite successful for the brand and the demand for breakfast menu items have increased substantially for the company. One possible solution that McDonald's might want to consider is to follow the lead of one of its smaller regional competitors, Jack-in-the-Box, which sells breakfast 24 hours per day. With the popularity of the Golden Arches' breakfasts, it might be a successful way to snag some additional market share and bolster sales and profits.

	<div class="details">
	<p>This strategy is specifically designed to engage the opposition with a head-on frontal assault. This also means using a substantial amount of resources and financial commitment when taking on a competitor with this strategy. From marketing to the production process, all elements are activated when initiating such an abrasive move. Advertising campaigns and new products are usually intensified to take on the competition where they are strongest; this is to weaken their market share and margins by cutting off their leading products and influencing their targeted audience to re-evaluate their loyalty to the brand or product. (Shayne Milligan. 2013)

	Burger King Corp. on Thursday unveiled a television advertising campaign that pits its Whopper sandwich against McDonald’s Big Mac and Wendy’s Single. The 15- and 30-second ads are based on the results of consumer taste tests of the three hamburgers. They highlight the reasons consumers chose the Whopper over the other two sandwiches.

	<div class="details">
	<p>Guerrilla marketing is traced to guerrilla warfare, which employs atypical tactics to achieve an objective. In 1984, the term guerrilla marketing was introduced by Leo Burnett's creative director Jay Conrad Levinson in his book Guerrilla Marketing. The term itself was from the inspiration of guerrilla warfare which was unconventional warfare using different techniques from usual and small tactic strategies used by armed civilians. It involves high imagination and energy to execute a guerrilla marketing campaign. This kind of marketing is purely focusing on taking the consumer by surprise, creating a greater impression and eventually leading to buzz through word-of-mouth or social media platforms. more precisely Ambush marketing, a type of guerrilla marketing. Ambush marketing is a form of associative marketing, used by an organization to capitalize upon the awareness, attention, goodwill, and other benefits, generated by having an association with an event or property, without that organization having an official or direct connection to that event or property

2015: Burger King made headlines with a surprising proposal for McDonalds: The two franchises team up on a hybrid burger called the “McWhopper.” Burger King took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to publish an “open letter” to McDonald’s. “How about we call a ceasefire on these so-called ‘burger wars’?” the letter asked. As BK’s letter envisioned it, the franchises’ cooperation, and the resulting burger, would raise awareness of Peace Day. Of course McDonald’s refused.
